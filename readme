mkfat is a command-line utility made for Linux and Windows that allows you to
create FAT 12/16/32 images with files from a specified directory, without the
need to use loop devices, mounting anything and requiring superuser privilege.


FORMAT

    mkfat <fat-type> <image-size> <image> <root> [-b boot]

The <fat-type> argument specifies numeric argument for the FAT type that is to
be created. It has to be either "12", "16" or "32". Other values are invalid.

The <image-size> argument specifies the size of the image to be created. If the
image of a given size doesn't support the given FAT type, then an error is
returned. The format of <image-size> is as follows:

    <decimal-number><unit>

Where <unit> is a letter, either "k", "m", "g" or nothing. They stand for
kilobyte, megabyte and gigabyte respectively. If no unit is specified, the
number is treated as the number of sectors.

The <image> is the filename of the image to be created. If the file <image>
already exists, it is overwritten.

The <root> points to the directory, from which the files are to be transferred
to the image. The tree is preserved. Note that the filenames in the image file
are going to be capitalised. Do not end the root directory name with forward
slash.

If you specify -b option, the first 512 bytes of the <boot> file are going to
be written to the image. The parts of the boot record that correspond to BPB
are going to get overwritten.


LIMITATIONS

Currently mkfat does not support unicode filenames and filenames that exceed
the 8.3 (DOS) format.
